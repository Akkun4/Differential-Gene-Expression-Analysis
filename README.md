Data files were in the .CEL file format. (GSE29431, GSE61304, GSE86374)

> *A CEL file is a data file created by Affymetrix DNA microarray image analysis software. It contains the data extracted from “probes” on an Affymetrix GeneChip and can store thousands of data points, which may make it large in file size.*
